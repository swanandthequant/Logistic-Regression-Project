## datasets
I made the dataset Myself using SKlearn.Dataset

## Methodolody
1. Model Training(I just made this dataset inside the file so no Data CLeaning was Needed and I used Logistic Regression)
2. Model Evaluation (using,accuracy_score,confusion_matrix,classification_report)
3. Hyper Parameter Tuning (Using Grid Search CV and Randamized Search CV)
4. Repeat The Things for Multiclass Classification Problem,Imbalanced Datasets,with ROC and ROC AUC Score

## what I learned
I learned about How the Logistic regression is derived How can we make Predictions By using Logistic Regression

## Project Updates
I am working on some thimg Big please stay tunned I will try to upload by today
Thank you everyone
