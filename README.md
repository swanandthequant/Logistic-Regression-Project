# Logistic Regression Experiments  

This project explores **Logistic Regression** with datasets generated using `sklearn.datasets`.  
The goal was to understand logistic regression better through different setups like binary, multi-class, and imbalanced classification problems.  

---

## Dataset  
- I created the dataset myself using **sklearn.datasets**.  
- Since the data was generated inside the file, no special cleaning was required.  

---

## Methodology  
1. Model Training (directly used Logistic Regression as no cleaning step was needed).  
2. Model Evaluation with:  
   - accuracy_score  
   - confusion_matrix  
   - classification_report  
3. Hyperparameter Tuning (using Grid Search CV and Randamized Search CV).  
4. Repeated the same process for:  
   - Multi-class classification problems  
   - Imbalanced datasets  
   - ROC and ROC AUC Score

## What I Learned  
- How Logistic Regression is derived and why it works for classification.  
- How predictions are made step by step using logistic regression.  
- The impact of class imbalance and evaluation beyond just accuracy.

## Project Updates  
- Currently working on something big, please stay tunned üôÇ  
- I‚Äôll try to upload the update by today.  

Thank you everyone üôè
